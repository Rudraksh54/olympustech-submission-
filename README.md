task1():

  ##Description
    Learning and navigating the basics of data science with the given problem statement.

  ##Approach
    This was centered around the given objective for each question, with the following line of action:

      Researching the necessary functions, tools, or libraries by studying their documentation.
      Bringing the required functions together by writing the appropriate pseudocode.
      Finally, implementing said pseudocode in accordance with the desired end result.

task2():

  ##Descrption 
    studying the desing and internal workings of a cubesat and then creating a presentation on a cubesat of our own making 

  ##approach
  this was centred on the following parameters and thier solutions 
    
    Mission Objectives: Define specific goals, such as measuring atmospheric composition, temperature, pressure, and cloud dynamics.

    Payload Selection: Choose appropriate instruments, like spectrometers for gas analysis, thermal sensors, and cameras for imaging.

    Thermal Protection: Develop a robust thermal management system to withstand Venus's extreme temperatures and pressures.

    Communication Systems: Design a communication link for data transmission back to Earth, considering the distance and atmospheric interference.

    Power Supply: Implement a reliable power system, such as solar panels, with battery storage for nighttime operations.

    Launch and Deployment: Plan for a launch vehicle and trajectory that allows for efficient insertion into orbit around Venus.

    Data Analysis: Establish protocols for data collection and analysis to ensure that findings contribute to our understanding of Venusâ€™s atmosphere.
